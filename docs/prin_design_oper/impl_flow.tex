\subsection{Program Flow}

\subsubsection{SystemBurn Scheduler Thread(s): (src/systemburn.c:main()):}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Initialize MPI/SHMEM
	\item All scheduler threads initialize global variables from command line options
	\item ROOT node scheduler thread (MPI/SHMEM rank 0) reads and broadcasts the configuration file to all ranks.
	\item All scheduler threads initialize the local error flag system
	\item All scheduler threads initialize the local performance data gathering system
	\item All scheduler threads spawn a single monitor thread on their node
	\item All scheduler threads spawn multiple worker threads on their node (initial load: "sleep")
	\item For each load do the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item ROOT scheduler thread reads and broadcasts the next load description
		\item ROOT scheduler thread logs the new load to standard out
		\item All scheduler threads update the plan structures for the worker threads on their node according to the new load
		\item While the new load runs:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item All scheduler threads on all nodes run the communication test (if it is enabled)
			\item ROOT scheduler thread checks time and broadcasts continuation, completion, and output flags
			\item All scheduler threads perform reduction and output of temperature state and error flag state at intervals
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Upon completion of all loads, stop all of the worker threads and clean up their traces in memory
	\item Sleep function: Sleep to get temperatures back to idle level
	\item Perform global reductions on gathered performance data and calculate simple statistics
	\item ROOT node logs performance data to standard out
	\item Finalize communication framework
	\item Exit 
\end{itemize} 

\subsubsection{SystemBurn Worker Threads: (src/worker.c:WorkerThread())}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Each worker thread consists of the following loop:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If the scheduler passes a NULL load plan, terminate this worker thread
		\item If the scheduler passes a new load plan:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Adjust thread affinity as required (newer kernels only)
			\item Log performance data from the previous load plan
			\item Clean up the previous load plan
			\item Install the new load plan
			\item Initialize the new load plan
			\item If the initialization fails switch to the "sleep" plan
		\end{itemize}
		\item run the load
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
